## Basics of React and Redux

### index_redux_no_lib.html
contains a custom implementation of a store in order to understand better how redux works.

#### index_learn_react.html
contains a todo app using react-redux and react-thunk.

#### todos folder
contains an react app scaffoled with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
The implementation is the same as in `index_learn_react.html` but the functions are splitted up in files organized in "Rails style" folder structure.
